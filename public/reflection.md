# My First Quarter Reflection


## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences:

* I understand how If-Else statements control the flow of the program I am making. It plays a really big part in programming because it checks and confirms if a statement is true or false. And I think I am confident enough when it comes to this topic.

* I already understand the differences between the different variable declarations. I still need a little more practice with this topic though.

* I already have a good understanding on while and for loops. They are a crucial part when repeating actions multiple times. through practice since last year, I got used to writing them correctly but I still have room for improvement.

* I already got a good grasp of HTML and CSS. All I need are a few more exercises and practice.

* Lastly, I already know how to use markdown well and can apply them like in this reflection :D



## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.

* I still need to improve my skills on arithmetic operators. I still need to practice exercises that include arithmetic operators.

* Arrays has been confusing for me and I really need more practice on it. I still need to fix my confusion on the different methods like the mutating and non mutating methods which changes the original array and others return a new one.

* I need to remove my carelessness about logical operators. These are crucial for writing conditions and is a big part of coding. I have a good understanding of each operator but I still need more practice in using them.

* The MathRandom topic is another topic i need practice in. I was able to get an understanding about it while making the code but there are still some confusion.

* I still need to learn more about the different parses like the parselnt and parseFloat. I still need more discussions about this topic and more practice to avoid confusions.

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

For me, the only way I can help myself understand further the topics is by practicing. I should practice the different things I learned this first quarter to avoid my carelessness in coding.

##  In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why? 
        
In the activities done in class, every activity done in class were effective for me. Each and every activity helped me learn new things and help me grow and grow as I continue to hone my skils and aim for mastery. Sir Roy made sure that each activity we did in class were fun and helped us determine our strengths and weaknesses in CS.
